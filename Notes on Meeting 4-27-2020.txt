Notes on Meeting 4-27-2020
* IMPORT custom functions
	- functions which return a boolean for WHERE clauses
	- functions which return a list of matches for custom FINDs

* Check further on the cases where something other than default behavior is used.

* IF NEVER FOUND is a good idea.

* Look at code for var_check, make a decision

* Think about how to implement .find_all more in the specification language.

* LOOK AT THE CODE ALREADY WRITTEN MORE, make decisions. LOOK AT THE PEDAL DOCS again.
